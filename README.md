Example IoT security assessment on physical prototype device. Demonstrates hardware hacking techniques including UART debug shell exploitation, SHA-1 password hash cracking, SWD flash memory dumping, and unencrypted data stream interception on an STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller. Conducted for COSC 6840 Ethical Hacking at Marquette University.

This file contains the formal report and presentation of the security assessment.
